# group-proj-one

## Description

Webpage built by Git-Vdim-Hub, gengamask, bertintshisuaka2 and Tiel23 with a list of the best scenic driving routes in the United States with a search feature to find scenic routes in a state, and present a map of the route location. Additionally show the 3 day forecast for that area.

- The developers of this team came together as they all have a passion for driving and taking in the scenes. In order to find senic routes in a state, we built this product. This website provides drivers a resource to reference! The biggest takeaway was learning how to develop a website as a team in github with vanilla javascript. Additionally, combining multiple APIs, and using webpage local storage, DOM, bootstrap and dayjs cdn's.
